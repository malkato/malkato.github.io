title: Homelab - RF Experience - Nooelec NESDR SMArt v5
---

## Description

Some time ago I got quite excited of being able to listen different frequencies and ended up experimenting publicly available WebSDR's.
These devices are capable of sending and receiving RF singnals. For my own lab, best suitable option was this tiny USB-powered SDR Nooelec NESDR SMArt v5, which would be integrated to my Raspberry PI. With this device, I could expand the capabilities of the microcompute and experiment some radio tech. Simple project example could be that the SDR would be used to receive GPS-signals to track airplanes.

Finally I received my SDR and right away put it on test.

## Installing software to Raspberry PI

I have currently Portainer and different container services running on the PI. Now I will take a remote connection to the device and install some necessary packets to support the fresh SDR.
