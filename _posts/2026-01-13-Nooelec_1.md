title: Homelab - RF Experience - Nooelec NESDR SMArt v5
---

## Description

Some time ago I got quite excited of being able to listen different frequencies and ended up experimenting publicly available WebSDR's.
These devices are capable of sending and receiving RF signals. For my own lab, best suitable option was this tiny USB-powered SDR Nooelec NESDR SMArt v5, which would be integrated to my Raspberry PI. With this device, I could expand the capabilities of the microcompute and experiment some radio tech. Simple project example could be that the SDR would be used to receive GPS-signals to track airplanes.

Some details of this SDR from their page:

```
✔ NESDR SMArt SDR in black brushed aluminum enclosure
✔ Antenna base w/ 2m RG58 cable
✔ Telescopic antenna mast (variable frequency)
✔ 433MHz (ISM) antenna mast (fixed frequency)
✔ UHF antenna mast (fixed frequency)
```

SDR Specifications:

````
✔ RTL2832U Demodulator/USB interface IC
✔ R820T2/R860 tuner IC
✔ 0.5PPM, ultra-low phase noise TCXO
✔ RF-suitable voltage regulator
✔ Shielded primary inductor
✔ Integrated custom heatsink
✔ Female SMA antenna input
✔ High-quality black brushed aluminum enclosure
````
Antenna Specifications:
````
✔ Wide base with super-strong magnet within base for easy mounting
✔ Low-loss RG58 feed cable
✔ 2m (6.5') cable, twice as long as most low cost SDR antennas
✔ Male SMA connector for direct connection to the SDR or our other SMA-connected accessories
````
TCXO Specifications:
````
✔ Frequency stability: 0.5PPM (max)
✔ Phase noise @1kHz offset: -138dBc/Hz (or better)
✔ Phase noise @10kHz: -150dBc/Hz (or better)
✔ Phase noise @100kHz: -152dBc/Hz (or better) 
`````

Finally I received my SDR and right away put it on test.

## Installing software to Raspberry PI

I have currently Portainer and different container services running on the PI. Now I will take a remote connection to the device and install some necessary packets to support the fresh SDR.

Ended up compiling the SDR++ from public repository. Here are commands I used:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install cmake git build-essential libglfw3-dev libglew-dev libzstd-dev libairspyhf-dev libiio-dev libad9361-dev libairspy-dev librtlsdr-dev libcodec2-dev libfftw3-dev libsoapysdr-dev p7zip-full wget
```

```
git clone https://github.com/AlexandreRouma/SDRPlusPlus.git
cd SDRPlusPlus
```

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DOPT_BUILD_RTL_SDR_SOURCE=ON -- Depending on your SDR hardware, this is for RTL SDR
make -j4
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

After the installation, just type sdrpp into terminal and the program will popup. Changed the correct SDR from the source options and it automaticly recognized my SDR-hardware

Now once the setup is ready, this can be served to my local network. By using following parameter in the startup command:
```
sdrpp -server
```

Install SDR++ for another device and select RTL-TCP as an option.
