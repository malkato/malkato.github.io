title: Homelab - Beelink ME mini + TrueNas Scale
---
## Description

By the time my homelab is growing one important factor needs to be covered which is NAS (Network Attached Storage). This will ensure that all of my backups will be in one place and stored securely. I received my M.2 SSD supported minipc, Beelink ME mini. This tiny powerhouse has 6 slots for M.2 SSD cards, 4 core N150 Intel Chip and 16GB of LPDDR5-4800 memory. 2 network ports supporting 2.5gb traffic, which will make the file transferring into next level. <https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-me-mini-n150> 

I got quite frustrated while copying videos, files and backups into external harddrives, which rely entirely on the USB and harddrive capabilities. This device fits perfectly into my GeekPI Rackmate and is noiseless. 

## TrueNas - Scale 

Beelink itself comes with Windows installation but right away, I flashed TrueNas Scale into my USB-stick and installed it. It was pretty straightforward, both authentication and network interfaces needed some configuration. Let's explore some options and capabilities of TrueNas.

A lot of different handy applications supported for example **n8n automation**, **Grafana** and **ESPHome**. Of course **NextCloud** filesharing server and **Jellyfin** for local "Netflix"

This one seems to be interesting, it could replace my current Notion setup.

## Storage 

I have currently attached following ssd's into the Beelink -- these are mirroring each other for redundancy but maximizing the capacity, since I want to have different poolsizes:

- 2x 1tb Samsung Nvme - Pool 1tb
- 2x 2tb WD SN7100 Nvme - Pool 2tb
- 1x 500gb Samsung 970 Evo for Truenas OS

## SMB-sharing

For serving purposes, I ended up enabling SMB for both storage pools and made an user for this use case. Separate user for the SMB is making the sharing more secure and privileges can be determined in much controlled way.

In TrueNas each storage pools need to have a dataset instead of serving directly from the storage root. This can be easily done via the Datasets section and determining the SMB-preset for SMB-sharing.

After the SMB-sharing is enabled, connection can be tested from i.e. Windows File Explorer:

```
\\yourtruenasip\SMBsharename
```
Now you need to provide credentials made for that SMB-share in Windows login. TrueNas accounts can be added from *Credentials - Users - Add User*.

## NAS --> Proxmox storage

I have been experiencing the NAS as useful storage for virtual machine images and filesharing in general for my Proxmox nodes.

Once the SMB-sharing has been enabled in TrueNas the same credentials as in Windows - can be used in Proxmox as integrated network storage.

Just specify *ID* as name for storage then TrueNas ip and credentials. Once set by clicking dropdown menu *Share* Proxmox will automaticly enumerate the SMB with provided credentials and your dataset should show in that box. This will be added for all nodes by default.


## Future

I will be receiving an HPE Aruba switch soon and will write about it later on.
