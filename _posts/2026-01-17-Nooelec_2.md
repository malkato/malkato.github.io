title: Homelab - RF Experience - HAOS SDR Datacenter - MQTT + SDR
---

## Description

One of my Proxmox nodes is running a HomeAssistant VM. This will be useful since more hardware is available for projects and could be integrated into HAOS. 
This operating system has addons for different protocols especially MQTT and this could be used as receiver for my incoming SDR-data from Raspberry PI.

Great project and software, which helps to identify a lot of different devices via the RF-datastream. 

## Docker Deployment on PI
`

```
services:
  rtl-433:
    image: hertzg/rtl_433:master-alpine-linux_arm64_v8 # Docker image
    hostname: rtl-433
    container_name: rtl-433
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: 
      - "-c/etc/rtl_433/rtl_433.conf"
    volumes:
      - ./config/rtl_433.conf:/etc/rtl_433/rtl_433.conf:ro # Configuration (lis>
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
      - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
    devices:
      - /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb

```

After saving the .yml file you can start the container as daemon (might need run as sudo):
```
docker compose up -d
```
