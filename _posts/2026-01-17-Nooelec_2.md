title: Homelab - RF Experience - HAOS SDR Datacenter - MQTT + SDR
---

## Description

One of my Proxmox nodes is running a HomeAssistant VM. This will be useful since more hardware is available for projects and could be integrated into HAOS. 
This operating system has addons for different protocols especially MQTT and this could be used as receiver for my incoming SDR-data from Raspberry PI.

<https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433>

Great project and software, which helps to identify a lot of different devices via the RF-datastream. 

## Docker Deployment on PI

Example configuration can be found from the repository.

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/merbanan/rtl_433/refs/heads/master/conf/rtl_433.example.conf>

Setup HAOS MQTT Broker first and check the port its running on. My broker runs on port 1883 by default. This needs to be set in the rtl_433.conf in order to receive any data.

Changes done in rtl_433.conf:

## General options

# as command line option:
#   [-v] Increase verbosity (can be used multiple times).
#        -v : verbose notice, -vv : verbose info, -vvv : debug, -vvvv : trace.
# 1=fatal, 2=critical, 3=error, 4=warning (default), 5=notice, 6=info, 7=debug, 8=trace
verbose <-------- uncheck / enable verbose for output

# as command line option:
#   [-f <frequency>] [-f...] Receive frequency(s) (default: 433920000 Hz)
# default is "433.92M", other reasonable values are 315M, 345M, 915M and 868M
frequency     915M <----- Setting up the frequency, can use multiple entries

# as command line option:
#   [-H <seconds>] Hop interval for polling of multiple frequencies (default: 600 seconds)
# default is "600" seconds, only used when multiple frequencies are given
hop_interval  60 <------ Interval for changing frequencies

# as command line option:
#   [-s <sample rate>] Set sample rate (default: 250000 Hz)
# default is "250k", other valid settings are 1024k, 2048k, 3200k
sample_rate   1M  <---- Sample Rate to 1 million, how wide spectrum you want to listen to. Higher = more demanding.

#   [-F http[:[//]bind[:port]] (default: 0.0.0.0:8433)
#     Add a HTTP API server, a UI is at e.g. http://localhost:8433/
# default is "kv", multiple outputs can be used.
output mqtt://homeassistant_ip:1883,user=username,pass=password,retain=0 <--- specifying the mqtt broker address & credentials
output json
output log
output kv
```

Docker Compose file:

```

After saving the .yml file you can start the container as daemon (might need run as sudo):
```
docker compose up -d
```
Terminal should show the image being pulled and the container running. Can be checked:
```
docker ps

user@raspberrypi:~/Desktop/container/rtl_433 $ sudo docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                         COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                 PORTS                                                                                                NAMES
