title: Homelab - Wazuh deployment
---
## Description

Migrated all my container services (Gitlab & Postgresql) to a single node in Proxmox and wanted to have space for some kind of system, which would gather logs and events from endpoints. This another single node has 8 cores and 16gb ram for Wazuh SIEM & XDR solution. Deployment is pretty straightforward and needs the core components (Wazuh Indexer, Wazuh Manager, Wazuh Dashboard and Filebeat). These will be included in the virtual machine image (.ova). In the future I would want to make a simple program to format and forward all the logs into Postgres database.

## Deployment


Starting up by copying the image into my NAS-server.

Creating a new empty virtual machine and allocated enough resources for cores and ram : Wazuh recommendation (4 cores & 8GB RAM)

Transferring the image from mounted storage : 
````
root@pve3:/mnt/pve/NAS/ProxmoxVM/Wazuh# cp wazuh-4.14.3.ova /var/lib/vz/template/iso/
````

Extracting files from the image (.ova)
````
root@pve3:/var/lib/vz/template/iso# tar -xvf wazuh-4.14.3.ova
wazuh-4.14.3.ovf
wazuh-4.14.3-disk-1.vmdk
wazuh-4.14.3.mf
````

Importing the (.vmdk) into the empty VM:

````
root@pve3:/var/lib/vz/template/iso# qm importdisk 105 wazuh-4.14.3-disk-1.vmdk local-lvm --format raw
importing disk 'wazuh-4.14.3-disk-1.vmdk' to VM 105 ...
  Logical volume "vm-105-disk-0" created.
  Logical volume pve/vm-105-disk-0 changed.
