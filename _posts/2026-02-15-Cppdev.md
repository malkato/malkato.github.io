title: Homelab - Gitlab deployment on C++ development
---
## Description

During my time sitting in my homelab, I eventually get tired of similar things and want to experiment more in this rabbit hole. I have been lately curious of learning to develop some Windows applications and then I got interested in customization of existing code. C++ is really powerful language and its mainly used for crossplatform application development. One tutorial video from YouTube started my curiosity towards C-languages and since I have spare hardware for self-hosting - next challenge came across, which was where would I store these applications entirely private. Gitlab is the answer, since its also opensource and can be run either in containers or virtual machines. Fortunately Proxmox has existing template for Gitlab deployment and this got me really exited of having an own private Gitlab.

IDE recommendation for C++ : <https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/>
GitHub Desktop for easy GUI repository management : <https://desktop.github.com/download/>

## Proxmox LXC - Gitlab

In Proxmox, you can choose the node local storage and *CT Templates*. From this view the template-option allows you to download preconfigured templates from Proxmox integration.

Once template download has been completed, you can create a new LXC Container for the node and use the template for it.

Choose template. Allocate enough disk space, memory and cpu-cores. Tested with 1 core and 512Mb of memory and the container could not start correctly.

Network settings is easy to setup to DHCP and let your router assign IP-address for the container.

The container can be started after creation and it will perform some configuration by itself e.g. setting up ssh keys for Proxmox VNC and configurations for Gitlab. The procedure is similar to Docker container - yaml-files. You need to access the final configuration portal via ssh to the container itself. Thats for initializing the Gitlab-system. Credentials are the same as specified in the container template creation.

SSH - Gitlab first boot configuration:

Once root-user and email set, updated the environment and rebooted - you can access the web-interface.

I encountered errors during the login but at first - you need to create a new user beside the root-user. This allows you to login with root. The fresh account needs to be approved from Gitlab settings with admin credentials in order to login.

Now you have successfully created own Gitlab instance into Proxmox LXC Container.

## Future
Continuing C++ learning in this environment. Going to use the Gitlab for code storage.
